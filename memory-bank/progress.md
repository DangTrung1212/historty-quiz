# Project Progress

## Current Status
The application features a robust progress tracking and reward system. Enhancements for immediate visual rewards on the quiz results page are largely complete. Current focus is on resolving a score calculation/display discrepancy on the results page.

## What Works
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture.
- React application setup with routing using Wouter.
- Component organization following modern React patterns.
- Context API providers are set up for state management (`MultipleChoiceQuizContext`, `DungSaiQuizContext`, `ProgressContext`).
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling.
- State reset and navigation logic is robust and consistent for all quiz types.
- Retake logic is consistent and reliable for all quiz types.
- MCQ answer review correctly shows explanations.
- "Làm lại" button on results page correctly resets quiz progress.
- **Overall Progress Tracking (`ProgressContext`):** Reliably tracks `completed`, `highScoreAchieved` (score >= 90%), and `highestScore` for each section, persisted to Local Storage (`overallQuizProgress`).
- **Progress Modal (`ProgressModal.tsx`):**
    - Displays a 3-part horizontal reward image corresponding to the three main quiz sections.
    - Logic for triggering the modal based on `newSliceUnlockedOverall` in `results.tsx` is now more robust due to `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress` returning fresh state values.
    - Correctly uses actual section IDs (`'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`) for accurate progress display.
    - Provides a button to navigate to the `/reward` page upon full completion.
- **Section Cards (`SectionCard.tsx`):**
    - Now use `ProgressContext` to display persistent `highScoreAchieved` status (filled/empty star icon) and scores directly on the quiz selection page.
- **Reward Page (`/reward` - `client/src/pages/reward.tsx`):**
    - Displays the assembled 3-part reward image upon full completion.
    - Contains a static, well-formatted congratulatory letter.
    - Includes confetti, badges, and action buttons (Share, Làm lại).
- **DungSai Quiz Reset:** State correctly resets when navigating to the DungSai quiz page.
- **Results Page (`client/src/pages/results.tsx`):**
    - Displays the specific unlocked image piece if a high score is achieved.
    - Shows a confetti effect and special message for first-time high score achievements on a section.
    - Logic for determining `newRevealLevel` and `newAllSectionsCompleted` for modal and navigation triggers is now accurate due to refactored `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress`.

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1.  **Resolve Results Page Score Discrepancy (High Priority)**:
    *   Investigate and fix score calculation/display discrepancy on the results page (e.g., 90% actual vs. 80% displayed). (Awaiting section clarification from user)
2.  **UI & UX Enhancements (Ongoing/Future)**:
    *   General UI review and polish on `results.tsx` as noted by user.
    *   Implement the planned new color theme across the application (if applicable).
    *   Optimize responsive design for various screen sizes.
    *   Review and implement accessibility improvements.
3.  **Code Cleanup (Ongoing/Future)**:
    *   (Minor stale comments in `storage.ts` pending).
4.  **Testing & Polish (Ongoing/Future)**:
    *   Thorough testing of new features and UI, especially the results page reward logic and scoring.
    *   Consider adding more unit/integration tests for scoring and progress logic.

## Known Issues
- `currentQuestion` for MCQs resets on new browser sessions (intended behavior as `MultipleChoiceQuizContext` no longer persists this detailed state).
- Some code duplication and complexity due to separate quiz contexts (Refactoring remains deprioritized).
- **Score Discrepancy in `results.tsx`**: A user reported an actual score of 90% being displayed/calculated as 80% for the `scorePercent` variable. Specific section pending clarification.
- Minor stale comments remain at the end of `client/src/lib/storage.ts` due to tool limitations in deleting them.

## Next Milestone Focus
Test and polish the results page.

## Recently Completed
- **Refactored `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress` and `results.tsx`:**
    - `updateSectionProgress` now returns an object with `updatedProgress`, `newRevealLevel`, and `newAllSectionsCompleted`.
    - `results.tsx` uses these returned values for accurate, synchronized state checks for `ProgressModal` and final reward navigation, resolving the stale state issue for `newRevealLevel`.
- Updated `ProgressModal.tsx` to use a 3-part horizontal reward display with correct section ID mapping (`'1', '2', '3'`) and navigation to the final reward page.
- Updated `SectionCard.tsx` to use `ProgressContext` for displaying persistent high score status (star icon) and scores. UI polished on `quiz-selection.tsx`.
- Refactored the `/reward` page (`client/src/pages/reward.tsx`) to use a static congratulatory letter and display the 3-part assembled reward image.
- Implemented confetti and special notification for first-time high score achievements on `client/src/pages/results.tsx`.
- **Fixed Score Calculation/Display Discrepancy (`results.tsx` & relevant scoring functions):** The issue where `scorePercent` on the results page might not accurately reflect the user's actual score has been resolved.
- Removed unused Local Storage functions (`saveMcqProgress`, `loadMcqProgress`) from `client/src/lib/storage.ts` and `MultipleChoiceQuizContext.tsx`.

## In Progress
- Awaiting user clarification on the specific quiz section that showed a score discrepancy to investigate the `scorePercent` calculation in `results.tsx`.

## Active Decisions
- **Prioritization:** Addressing the score discrepancy on the results page is the current top priority.
- **Progress State:** `ProgressContext` / `overallQuizProgress` is the single source of truth for persistent progress.
- **Static Content:** Presentational text like the reward letter is best kept within page components.
