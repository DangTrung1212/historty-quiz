# Project Progress

## Current Status
The project is progressing through a refactor of the "Trắc Nghiệm Đúng Sai" (True/False) quiz section. This section now uses its own context and UI, with dedicated answer storage and custom score calculation logic. The navigation button is at the bottom and is disabled until all statements are answered.

## What Works
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture
- React application setup with routing using Wouter
- Component organization following modern React patterns
- Context API providers are set up for state management
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling
- Finalized UI/UX decisions for "Trắc Nghiệm Đúng Sai" section:
  - Navigation button shows "Tiếp theo" except on the last question, where it shows "Nộp bài"
  - User selection for Đúng/Sai is highlighted visually (no extra text like "Bạn đã chọn: ...")
  - No correct/incorrect feedback is shown until after submission
  - Long passages are handled with collapsible or scrollable containers
  - Navigation button is at the bottom and disabled until all statements are answered
  - Dedicated context and answer storage for True/False section
  - Custom score calculation logic (0: 100%, 1: 50%, 2: 25%, 3: 10%, all: 0%)

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1. **Quiz Functionality**:
   - Complete answer storage and navigation logic for True/False section
