# Project Progress

## Current Status
The application is largely stable with major bugs addressed. Focus is shifting towards new features and UI enhancements.

## What Works
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture
- React application setup with routing using Wouter
- Component organization following modern React patterns
- Context API providers are set up for state management
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling
- Finalized UI/UX decisions for "Trắc Nghiệm Đúng Sai" section
- State reset and navigation logic is now robust and consistent for all quiz types
- Infinite render loop in DungSaiQuiz is fixed
- Retake logic is consistent and reliable for all quiz types
- MCQ answer review now always shows explanations if available
- "Làm lại" button on results page correctly resets MCQ quiz progress
- MCQ re-render issue when starting/navigating to a quiz is resolved for in-session progress

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1. **Reward System Implementation**:
   - Finalize image slice unlocking mechanism upon high scores
   - Develop the final reward screen (full image reveal and congratulatory message)
   - Ensure robust integration with quiz completion and scoring from all quiz types

2. **UI & UX Enhancements**:
   - Implement the planned new color theme across the application
   - Conduct a general UI review and implement improvements for visual appeal and intuitiveness
   - Optimize responsive design for various screen sizes
   - Review and implement accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, etc.)

3. **Bug Fixing & Polish**:
   - Address any remaining minor bugs or visual inconsistencies
   - Perform thorough testing of all features, especially the reward system and new UI elements
   - Consider adding more unit/integration tests for new features

## Known Issues
- `currentQuestion` for MCQs resets on new browser sessions due to type limitations in `loadProgress` from `lib/storage.ts`. In-session progress is preserved
- Some code duplication and complexity due to separate quiz contexts (Refactoring to be considered post current priorities)

## Notes
- Primary focus: UI improvements and reward feature implementation

## Milestones
- [x] Project setup and structure established
- [x] Documentation framework created
- [x] Refactor True/False section to use dedicated context and UI
- [x] Ensure correct score calculation and answer review for True/False section
- [x] Robust state reset and navigation for all quiz types
- [x] Fix infinite render loop in DungSaiQuiz
- [x] Consistent retake logic for all quiz types
- [x] Fix outstanding application bugs (major ones related to quiz state/navigation)
- [ ] Implement new color theme
- [ ] Implement reward feature (image unlock, final screen)
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive UI/UX overhaul
- [ ] Full testing of new features and UI

## Next Milestone Focus
Implement the reward system and complete the UI/UX enhancements, including the new color theme

## Recently Completed
- Fixed state reset and navigation bugs for Đúng/Sai (DungSai) quiz
- Fixed infinite render loop in DungSaiQuiz component
- Made state reset logic consistent for all quiz types (retake, navigation, etc.)
- Improved context provider placement and usage to avoid unmount/remount bugs
- Decoupled navigation from state reset (using router hooks, not window.location)
- Resolved MCQ re-render issue for in-session progress
- Updated MCQ answer review to always show explanations
- Fixed "Làm lại" button for MCQs to reset progress

## In Progress
- Developing the reward system mechanics and UI
- Identifying and planning UI/UX enhancements (including color theme)
- Ongoing minor bug fixing and polish

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Reward Feature**
2. **Improve UI/UX** (including color theme, responsiveness, accessibility)
3. **Bug Fixing** (address any remaining issues)
4. **Testing & Polish**
5. **Update Documentation** (Memory Bank)

## Active Decisions
- **Prioritization:** Focus is now on UI/UX improvements and the reward feature. Refactoring is deprioritized
- **Unification:** Move away from separate contexts for each quiz type (This decision might be revisited or deprioritized given the new focus)
- **Encapsulation:** All state transitions (start, answer, reset, complete) will be handled by context methods (This decision might be revisited or deprioritized)
