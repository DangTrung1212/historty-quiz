# Project Progress

## Current Status
The application features a robust progress tracking and reward system. The primary focus is now on enhancing the user experience by showing immediate visual rewards (unlocked image pieces) on the quiz results page.

## What Works
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture.
- React application setup with routing using Wouter.
- Component organization following modern React patterns.
- Context API providers are set up for state management (`MultipleChoiceQuizContext`, `DungSaiQuizContext`, `ProgressContext`).
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling.
- State reset and navigation logic is robust and consistent for all quiz types.
- Retake logic is consistent and reliable for all quiz types.
- MCQ answer review correctly shows explanations.
- "Làm lại" button on results page correctly resets quiz progress.
- **Overall Progress Tracking (`ProgressContext`):** Reliably tracks `completed`, `highScoreAchieved` (score >= 90%), and `highestScore` for each section, persisted to Local Storage (`overallQuizProgress`).
- **Progress Modal (`ProgressModal.tsx`):**
    - Displays a 3-part horizontal reward image corresponding to the three main quiz sections.
    - Each part shows an image piece (blurred if not all complete, clear if all complete) or a locked status.
    - Correctly uses actual section IDs (`'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`) for accurate progress display.
    - Provides a button to navigate to the `/reward` page upon full completion.
- **Section Cards (`SectionCard.tsx`):**
    - Now use `ProgressContext` to display persistent `highScoreAchieved` status (filled/empty star icon) and scores directly on the quiz selection page.
- **Reward Page (`/reward` - `client/src/pages/reward.tsx`):**
    - Displays the assembled 3-part reward image upon full completion.
    - Contains a static, well-formatted congratulatory letter (no longer from `ProgressContext`).
    - Includes confetti, badges, and action buttons (Share, Làm lại).
- **DungSai Quiz Reset:** State correctly resets when navigating to the DungSai quiz page.

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1.  **Display Unlocked Image on Results Page**:
    *   When a user achieves a high score on a quiz, the results page for that section should immediately display the specific image piece they've unlocked.

2.  **UI & UX Enhancements (Ongoing/Future)**:
    *   Implement the planned new color theme across the application (if applicable).
    *   Conduct a general UI review and implement improvements for visual appeal and intuitiveness.
    *   Optimize responsive design for various screen sizes.
    *   Review and implement accessibility improvements.

3.  **Code Cleanup (Ongoing/Future)**:
    *   Remove any unused Local Storage functions or old context logic if consolidation is fully complete.

4.  **Testing & Polish (Ongoing/Future)**:
    *   Thorough testing of new features and UI.
    *   Consider adding more unit/integration tests.

## Known Issues
- `currentQuestion` for MCQs resets on new browser sessions (intended behavior as `MultipleChoiceQuizContext` no longer persists this detailed state).
- Some code duplication and complexity due to separate quiz contexts (Refactoring remains deprioritized).

## Milestones
- [x] Project setup and structure established
- [x] Documentation framework created
- [x] Refactor True/False section to use dedicated context and UI
- [x] Ensure correct score calculation and answer review for True/False section
- [x] Robust state reset and navigation for all quiz types
- [x] Fix infinite render loop bugs
- [x] Consistent retake logic for all quiz types
- [x] Fix outstanding application bugs (major ones related to quiz state/navigation)
- [x] Implement highest score tracking in `ProgressContext`
- [x] Consolidate persistent progress storage to `overallQuizProgress` key
- [x] Implement Progress Modal with 3-part Reward Image & Navigation to full reward page
- [x] Update Section Cards to reflect persistent high scores
- [x] Refactor `/reward` page with static letter and 3-part image
- [ ] **Display Unlocked Image Piece on Quiz Results Page**
- [ ] Implement new color theme (if planned)
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive UI/UX overhaul (if planned)

## Next Milestone Focus
Implement the display of the unlocked image piece on the quiz results page immediately after a high score is achieved for a section.

## Recently Completed
- Updated `ProgressModal.tsx` to use a 3-part horizontal reward display with correct section ID mapping (`'1', '2', '3'`) and navigation to the final reward page.
- Updated `SectionCard.tsx` to use `ProgressContext` for displaying persistent high score status (star icon) and scores.
- Refactored the `/reward` page (`client/src/pages/reward.tsx`) to use a static congratulatory letter and display the 3-part assembled reward image.
- Deleted redundant `RewardPage.tsx`.

## In Progress
- Planning and starting implementation for displaying the specific unlocked image piece on the quiz results page.

## Active Decisions
- **Prioritization:** Focus is on showing immediate reward feedback on the results page.
- **Progress State:** `ProgressContext` / `overallQuizProgress` is the single source of truth for persistent progress.
- **Static Content:** Presentational text like the reward letter is best kept within page components.
