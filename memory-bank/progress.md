# Project Progress

## Current Status
The application has made significant strides in its development, with a focus on refining the user experience and enhancing visual appeal. The interactive birthday card feature is now functionally complete and themed, and the landing page has been re-styled to match the app's overall aesthetic. The project is moving towards a refinement and polishing phase, with a strong focus on mobile experience and data quality.

## What Works
- Core quiz functionalities (multiple choice, true/false) are stable.
- Score calculation and progress tracking via Context API are functional.
- `PageTurningCard` component:
  - Successfully simulates a book/card opening with `framer-motion`.
  - Displays a congratulatory message (left page) and a personalized, text-based birthday message (right page).
  - Responsive: Stacks pages vertically on mobile with a slide animation, and spreads horizontally on desktop with a flip animation.
  - Uses custom text with styling and icons for the message area, replacing the previous image-based approach.
- `reward.tsx` page correctly displays the `PageTurningCard` when all quiz sections are completed, passing the personalized message.
- `landing.tsx` page has been re-styled to match the app's overall theme (purple/pink gradients, animated decorative elements), providing a cohesive visual introduction.
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture
- React application setup with routing using Wouter
- Component organization following modern React patterns
- Context API providers for state management
- Basic quiz functionality and progress tracking
- Project features a robust progress tracking and reward system
- State reset and navigation logic is robust and consistent for all quiz types
- Retake logic is consistent and reliable for all quiz types
- Answer review system with smooth scrolling behavior
- "Làm lại" button on results page correctly resets quiz progress
- Score calculation and display issues have been resolved
- Auto-scrolling to answer review section when clicking "Xem đáp án"
- Consistent styling across all quiz components with romantic purple theme
- **Overall Progress Tracking (`ProgressContext`):** Reliably tracks `completed`, `highScoreAchieved` (score >= 90%), and `highestScore` for each section, persisted to Local Storage (`overallQuizProgress`).
- **Progress Modal (`ProgressModal.tsx`):**
    - Displays a 3-part horizontal reward image corresponding to the three main quiz sections.
    - Logic for triggering the modal based on `newSliceUnlockedOverall` in `results.tsx` is now more robust due to `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress` returning fresh state values.
    - Correctly uses actual section IDs (`'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`) for accurate progress display.
    - Provides a button to navigate to the `/reward` page upon full completion.
- **Section Cards (`SectionCard.tsx`):**
    - Now use `ProgressContext` to display persistent `highScoreAchieved` status (filled/empty star icon) and scores directly on the quiz selection page.
- **Reward Page (`/reward` - `client/src/pages/reward.tsx`):**
    - Displays the assembled 3-part reward image upon full completion.
    - Contains a static, well-formatted congratulatory letter.
    - Includes confetti, badges, and action buttons (Share, Làm lại).
- **DungSai Quiz Reset:** State correctly resets when navigating to the DungSai quiz page.
- **Results Page (`client/src/pages/results.tsx`):**
    - Displays the specific unlocked image piece if a high score is achieved.
    - Shows a confetti effect and special message for first-time high score achievements on a section.
    - Logic for determining `newRevealLevel` and `newAllSectionsCompleted` for modal and navigation triggers is now accurate due to refactored `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress`.

## What's In Progress
1. **Cross-Browser Testing**
   - Verifying consistent behavior across different browsers
   - Testing touch interactions on mobile devices
   - Ensuring animations work smoothly on all platforms

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implementing code splitting for better load times
   - Optimizing image assets
   - Reducing bundle size where possible

3. **User Feedback Collection**
   - Gathering feedback on the reward system
   - Identifying areas for improvement in the user journey
   - Validating the emotional impact of achievement moments

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1.  **Comprehensive Mobile UX Optimization**: Review and enhance the user experience on mobile devices across all parts of the application (quiz sections, navigation, results pages, etc.).
2.  **Birthday Card Finalization**:
    *   **Custom Fonts**: Select and integrate appropriate custom fonts for the birthday message to enhance its unique and personal feel.
    *   **Message Content & Layout**: Refine the specific wording, line breaks, and overall typographic layout of the message on the card for maximum impact.
    *   **Subtle Enhancements**: Consider minor additional animations or visual cues within the card content if they add to the experience without cluttering.
3.  **Data Curation - Table-Based Questions**: Identify and decide on handling for table-based questions in `question-json` files (e.g., remove or reformat if they don't fit the quiz UI).
4.  **Thorough Cross-Device Testing**: Test the entire application flow on various mobile devices and screen resolutions to catch any remaining UI/UX issues.

## Known Issues
- Potential for table-based questions in the data source that may not render well in the current quiz UI.
- `currentQuestion` for MCQs resets on new browser sessions (intended behavior as `MultipleChoiceQuizContext` no longer persists this detailed state)
- Some code duplication and complexity due to separate quiz contexts (Refactoring remains deprioritized)
- Minor stale comments remain at the end of `client/src/lib/storage.ts` (Low priority)
- Some button states may need additional visual feedback
- Reward reveal animations may need timing adjustments for optimal impact

## Recently Completed
- **Implemented Romantic Purple Theme**
  - Updated all UI components with consistent purple theme
  - Enhanced button states and visual feedback
  - Improved typography and spacing for better readability
  - Refined animations and transitions

- **Enhanced Results Page**
  - Redesigned score display with visual feedback
  - Improved progress indicators

- **Refactored `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress` and `results.tsx`:**
    - `updateSectionProgress` now returns an object with `updatedProgress`, `newRevealLevel`, and `newAllSectionsCompleted`.
    - `results.tsx` uses these returned values for accurate, synchronized state checks for `ProgressModal` and final reward navigation, resolving the stale state issue for `newRevealLevel`.
- Updated `ProgressModal.tsx` to use a 3-part horizontal reward display with correct section ID mapping (`'1', '2', '3'`) and navigation to the final reward page.
- Updated `SectionCard.tsx` to use `ProgressContext` for displaying persistent high score status (star icon) and scores. UI polished on `quiz-selection.tsx`.
- Refactored the `/reward` page (`client/src/pages/reward.tsx`) to use a static congratulatory letter and display the 3-part assembled reward image.
- Implemented confetti and special notification for first-time high score achievements on `client/src/pages/results.tsx`.
- **Fixed Score Calculation/Display Discrepancy (`results.tsx` & relevant scoring functions):** The issue where `scorePercent` on the results page might not accurately reflect the user's actual score has been resolved.
- Removed unused Local Storage functions (`saveMcqProgress`, `loadMcqProgress`) from `client/src/lib/storage.ts` and `MultipleChoiceQuizContext.tsx`.
- Fixed `getImageRevealLevel()` timing issue
- Implemented first-time high score celebration
- Cleaned up Local Storage usage
- Improved UI in quiz selection page
- Fixed score calculation/display issues

## In Progress
- No active issues

## Active Decisions
- **Prioritization:** Focus on testing and refining the progress reveal reward system.
- **Progress State:** `ProgressContext` / `overallQuizProgress` is the single source of truth for persistent progress.
- **Static Content:** Presentational text like the reward letter is best kept within page components.
- Prioritizing visual appeal and romantic theme
- Focusing on creating engaging reward content
- Maintaining good performance while enhancing visuals
- **Message Format**: Shifted from an image-based birthday message to a text-based one within `PageTurningCard`.
- **Responsive Strategy**: Adopted distinct mobile vs. desktop layouts/animations for `PageTurningCard`.
- **Theming**: Extended the romantic/celebratory theme to the landing page.
- **Data Quality**: Added a step to review and handle potentially problematic table-based questions.
