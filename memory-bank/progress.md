# Project Progress

## Current Status
The application is stable after resolving significant state management and lifecycle bugs. Focus is now shifting to implementing the core reward visualization (Progress Widget) and related UI enhancements.

## What Works
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture.
- React application setup with routing using Wouter.
- Component organization following modern React patterns.
- Context API providers are set up for state management (`MultipleChoiceQuizContext`, `DungSaiQuizContext`, `ProgressContext`).
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling.
- UI/UX for "Trắc Nghiệm Đúng Sai" section is implemented.
- State reset and navigation logic is robust and consistent for all quiz types (retake, navigating away/back).
- Infinite render loop bugs related to state updates and effect dependencies are fixed.
- Retake logic is consistent and reliable for all quiz types.
- MCQ answer review correctly shows explanations.
- "Làm lại" button on results page correctly resets quiz progress.
- **Overall Progress Tracking:** `ProgressContext` reliably tracks `completed`, `highScoreAchieved` (score >= 90%), and `highestScore` for each section.
- **Persistent Progress:** `ProgressContext` saves and loads the overall progress state to Local Storage under the `overallQuizProgress` key.
- **DungSai Quiz Reset:** State correctly resets when navigating to the DungSai quiz page.

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1. **Progress Widget & Reward Visualization**:
   - Implement the Progress Widget UI on the quiz selection page (`quiz-selection.tsx`).
   - Display the reward image within the widget, showing slices based on `ProgressContext.getImageRevealLevel()`.
   - Display highest scores per section (e.g., in the widget or on quiz cards) using `ProgressContext.getSectionHighestScore()`.

2. **UI & UX Enhancements**:
   - Implement the planned new color theme across the application.
   - Conduct a general UI review and implement improvements for visual appeal and intuitiveness.
   - Optimize responsive design for various screen sizes.
   - Review and implement accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, etc.).

3. **Code Cleanup**:
    - Remove unused Local Storage functions (`saveMcqProgress`, `loadMcqProgress`) from `lib/storage.ts` and related imports.

4. **Testing & Polish**:
   - Address any remaining minor bugs or visual inconsistencies.
   - Perform thorough testing of the progress widget, reward display, and overall quiz flow.
   - Consider adding more unit/integration tests for new features.

## Known Issues
- `currentQuestion` for MCQs resets on new browser sessions because `MultipleChoiceQuizContext` no longer persists this detailed state (this is now the intended behavior, focusing persistence on overall progress via `ProgressContext`).
- Some code duplication and complexity due to separate quiz contexts (Refactoring remains deprioritized).

## Milestones
- [x] Project setup and structure established
- [x] Documentation framework created
- [x] Refactor True/False section to use dedicated context and UI
- [x] Ensure correct score calculation and answer review for True/False section
- [x] Robust state reset and navigation for all quiz types
- [x] Fix infinite render loop bugs
- [x] Consistent retake logic for all quiz types
- [x] Fix outstanding application bugs (major ones related to quiz state/navigation)
- [x] Implement highest score tracking in `ProgressContext`
- [x] Consolidate persistent progress storage to `overallQuizProgress` key
- [ ] **Implement Progress Widget with Reward Image**
- [ ] Implement new color theme
- [ ] Conduct comprehensive UI/UX overhaul
- [ ] Full testing of new features and UI
- [ ] Cleanup unused storage code

## Next Milestone Focus
Implement the Progress Widget on the quiz selection page, including the reward image reveal and highest score display.

## Recently Completed
- Fixed state reset bug for DungSai quiz upon navigation.
- Fixed infinite render loop related to DungSai quiz reset.
- Wrapped context functions in `useCallback` to stabilize references.
- Implemented `highestScore` tracking in `ProgressContext`.
- Consolidated persistent progress tracking to `overallQuizProgress`, removing saves from `MultipleChoiceQuizContext`.

## In Progress
- Implementing the Progress Widget and integrating reward image display.

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Progress Widget UI & Logic** (integrating image slices and highest scores).
2. **Cleanup `lib/storage.ts`**.
3. **Improve UI/UX** (color theme, responsiveness, accessibility).
4. **Testing & Polish**.
5. **Update Documentation** (Memory Bank).

## Active Decisions
- **Prioritization:** Focus is now on the Progress Widget and reward visualization.
- **Progress State:** `ProgressContext` / `overallQuizProgress` is the single source of truth for persistent progress.
- **State Reset:** Component-level `useEffect` (like in `quiz.tsx`) is used for state resets triggered by navigation/mounting.
