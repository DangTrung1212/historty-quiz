# Project Progress

## Current Status
The project is now stable for both MCQ and DungSai quiz types, with robust state reset and navigation logic. All major bugs related to context, state sync, and retake logic have been fixed.

## What Works
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture
- React application setup with routing using Wouter
- Component organization following modern React patterns
- Context API providers are set up for state management
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling
- Finalized UI/UX decisions for "Trắc Nghiệm Đúng Sai" section
- State reset and navigation logic is now robust and consistent for all quiz types
- Infinite render loop in DungSaiQuiz is fixed
- Retake logic is consistent and reliable for all quiz types

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1. **Quiz Functionality**:
   - Refactor to a unified QuizContext for all quiz types
   - Move business logic (scoring, validation) to pure functions in lib/
   - Update all components and pages to use the new context API
   - Add/expand unit tests for quiz logic
   
2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Ensure localStorage persistence and hydration is robust for unified context
   - Section completion status management
   
3. **Reward System**:
   - Image slice unlocking mechanism (final polish)
   - Final reward screen with full image reveal
   - Congratulatory message display
   
4. **UI Refinement**:
   - Responsive design optimization
   - Animation and transition effects
   - Accessibility improvements

## Known Issues
- No critical context/state bugs remain
- Some code duplication and complexity due to separate quiz contexts (to be addressed in refactor)
- Issue: When clicking 'Chọn Trắc Nghiệm I', the question is re-rendered (potential unnecessary rerender or state reset).

## Notes
- Implement reward function and UI should be done in a separate branch (not in current mainline work).

## Milestones
- [x] Project setup and structure established
- [x] Documentation framework created
- [x] Refactor True/False section to use dedicated context and UI
- [x] Ensure correct score calculation and answer review for True/False section
- [x] Robust state reset and navigation for all quiz types
- [x] Fix infinite render loop in DungSaiQuiz
- [x] Consistent retake logic for all quiz types
- [ ] Refactor to unified QuizContext
- [ ] Move business logic to pure functions
- [ ] Update documentation and Memory Bank after refactor
- [ ] Complete UI implementation
- [ ] Testing and optimization
- [ ] Deployment preparation

## Next Milestone Focus
Refactor to a single, unified QuizContext for all quiz types and update documentation accordingly.

## Recently Completed
- Fixed state reset and navigation bugs for Đúng/Sai (DungSai) quiz
- Fixed infinite render loop in DungSaiQuiz component
- Made state reset logic consistent for all quiz types (retake, navigation, etc.)
- Improved context provider placement and usage to avoid unmount/remount bugs
- Decoupled navigation from state reset (using router hooks, not window.location)

## In Progress
- Planning and designing a unified QuizContext to handle all quiz types
- Identifying shared logic and moving it to pure functions/hooks

## Next Steps
- Refactor to a single, unified QuizContext for all quiz types
- Move business logic (scoring, validation) to pure functions in lib/
- Update all components and pages to use the new context API
- Update documentation and Memory Bank to reflect the new architecture

## Active Decisions
- **Unification:** Move away from separate contexts for each quiz type
- **Encapsulation:** All state transitions (start, answer, reset, complete) will be handled by context methods
- **Testing:** Pure logic functions will be tested in isolation
