# Project Progress

## Current Status
The application has been successfully updated with a romantic purple theme across all pages. Recent UI/UX improvements include enhanced scrolling behavior, consistent styling across quiz components, and improved answer review functionality. The focus is now on ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience across all devices.

## What Works
- Project structure is established with client/server architecture
- React application setup with routing using Wouter
- Component organization following modern React patterns
- Context API providers for state management
- Basic quiz functionality and progress tracking
- Project features a robust progress tracking and reward system
- State reset and navigation logic is robust and consistent for all quiz types
- Retake logic is consistent and reliable for all quiz types
- Answer review system with smooth scrolling behavior
- "Làm lại" button on results page correctly resets quiz progress
- Score calculation and display issues have been resolved
- Auto-scrolling to answer review section when clicking "Xem đáp án"
- Consistent styling across all quiz components with romantic purple theme
- **Overall Progress Tracking (`ProgressContext`):** Reliably tracks `completed`, `highScoreAchieved` (score >= 90%), and `highestScore` for each section, persisted to Local Storage (`overallQuizProgress`).
- **Progress Modal (`ProgressModal.tsx`):**
    - Displays a 3-part horizontal reward image corresponding to the three main quiz sections.
    - Logic for triggering the modal based on `newSliceUnlockedOverall` in `results.tsx` is now more robust due to `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress` returning fresh state values.
    - Correctly uses actual section IDs (`'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`) for accurate progress display.
    - Provides a button to navigate to the `/reward` page upon full completion.
- **Section Cards (`SectionCard.tsx`):**
    - Now use `ProgressContext` to display persistent `highScoreAchieved` status (filled/empty star icon) and scores directly on the quiz selection page.
- **Reward Page (`/reward` - `client/src/pages/reward.tsx`):**
    - Displays the assembled 3-part reward image upon full completion.
    - Contains a static, well-formatted congratulatory letter.
    - Includes confetti, badges, and action buttons (Share, Làm lại).
- **DungSai Quiz Reset:** State correctly resets when navigating to the DungSai quiz page.
- **Results Page (`client/src/pages/results.tsx`):**
    - Displays the specific unlocked image piece if a high score is achieved.
    - Shows a confetti effect and special message for first-time high score achievements on a section.
    - Logic for determining `newRevealLevel` and `newAllSectionsCompleted` for modal and navigation triggers is now accurate due to refactored `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress`.

## What's Left to Build/Complete
1.  **Progress Reward System**
    *   Test and refine the reward reveal experience
    *   Ensure smooth transitions between quiz completion and reward display
    *   Add visual feedback for different achievement levels

2.  **UI & UX Polish**
    *   Complete final UI review of all interactive elements
    *   Ensure consistent button states and hover effects
    *   Verify all animations are smooth and purposeful

3.  **Testing & Validation**
    *   Conduct user testing for the reward flow
    *   Verify all quiz types trigger rewards correctly
    *   Ensure progress persists correctly across sessions

4.  **Performance Optimization**
    *   Optimize animations for smooth performance
    *   Ensure quick loading of reward assets
    *   Verify all interactive elements respond promptly

## Known Issues
- `currentQuestion` for MCQs resets on new browser sessions (intended behavior as `MultipleChoiceQuizContext` no longer persists this detailed state)
- Some code duplication and complexity due to separate quiz contexts (Refactoring remains deprioritized)
- Minor stale comments remain at the end of `client/src/lib/storage.ts` (Low priority)
- Some button states may need additional visual feedback
- Reward reveal animations may need timing adjustments for optimal impact

## Recently Completed
- **Implemented Romantic Purple Theme**
  - Updated all UI components with consistent purple theme
  - Enhanced button states and visual feedback
  - Improved typography and spacing for better readability
  - Refined animations and transitions

- **Enhanced Results Page**
  - Redesigned score display with visual feedback
  - Improved progress indicators
  - Consistent button styling and interactions
  - Better visual hierarchy for important information

- **Refactored `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress` and `results.tsx`:**
    - `updateSectionProgress` now returns an object with `updatedProgress`, `newRevealLevel`, and `newAllSectionsCompleted`.
    - `results.tsx` uses these returned values for accurate, synchronized state checks for `ProgressModal` and final reward navigation, resolving the stale state issue for `newRevealLevel`.
- Updated `ProgressModal.tsx` to use a 3-part horizontal reward display with correct section ID mapping (`'1', '2', '3'`) and navigation to the final reward page.
- Updated `SectionCard.tsx` to use `ProgressContext` for displaying persistent high score status (star icon) and scores. UI polished on `quiz-selection.tsx`.
- Refactored the `/reward` page (`client/src/pages/reward.tsx`) to use a static congratulatory letter and display the 3-part assembled reward image.
- Implemented confetti and special notification for first-time high score achievements on `client/src/pages/results.tsx`.
- **Fixed Score Calculation/Display Discrepancy (`results.tsx` & relevant scoring functions):** The issue where `scorePercent` on the results page might not accurately reflect the user's actual score has been resolved.
- Removed unused Local Storage functions (`saveMcqProgress`, `loadMcqProgress`) from `client/src/lib/storage.ts` and `MultipleChoiceQuizContext.tsx`.
- Fixed `getImageRevealLevel()` timing issue
- Implemented first-time high score celebration
- Cleaned up Local Storage usage
- Improved UI in quiz selection page
- Fixed score calculation/display issues

## In Progress
- No active issues

## Active Decisions
- **Prioritization:** Focus on testing and refining the progress reveal reward system.
- **Progress State:** `ProgressContext` / `overallQuizProgress` is the single source of truth for persistent progress.
- **Static Content:** Presentational text like the reward letter is best kept within page components.
- Prioritizing visual appeal and romantic theme
- Focusing on creating engaging reward content
- Maintaining good performance while enhancing visuals
