# Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Test and Polish Results Page (`results.tsx`)**

## Recently Completed
- **Fixed `getImageRevealLevel()` Timing Issue (`results.tsx` & `ProgressContext.tsx`):**
    - Refactored `ProgressContext.updateSectionProgress` to calculate and return `newRevealLevel` and `newAllSectionsCompleted` status directly, based on the updated progress data.
    - Updated `results.tsx` to use these returned values, ensuring accurate and synchronized state for `ProgressModal` trigger logic and final reward navigation.
- **Results Page - First-Time High Score Celebration (`client/src/pages/results.tsx`):**
    - Implemented confetti effect and a special notification message for first-time high scores.
- **Local Storage Cleanup (`client/src/lib/storage.ts`, `client/src/contexts/MultipleChoiceQuizContext.tsx`):**
    - Removed unused legacy Local Storage functions and keys.
- **UI Polish (`client/src/pages/quiz-selection.tsx`):**
    - Improved header subtitle and progress widget clarity.
    - Resolved a linter error.
- **Fixed Score Calculation/Display Discrepancy (`results.tsx` & relevant scoring functions):** The issue where `scorePercent` on the results page might not accurately reflect the user's actual score has been resolved.

## In Progress
- Testing and polishing the results page.

## Next Steps
1.  **Test Results Page Extensively:** Thoroughly test various scenarios including score accuracy for all quiz types.
2.  **UI/UX Polish on `results.tsx`**: Address general UX improvements as noted by the user.

## Active Decisions
- **Prioritization:** Fixing the score discrepancy on `results.tsx` is the highest priority.
- **Single Source of Truth for Progress:** `ProgressContext` and `overallQuizProgress` Local Storage key.

## Blockers/Questions
- None currently.

## New Issues & Notes
- Minor stale comments at the end of `client/src/lib/storage.ts` (Low priority).
