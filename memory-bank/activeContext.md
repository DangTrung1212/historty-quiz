# Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Finalizing Interactive Birthday Card**
  - Ensuring consistent theming
  - Preparing for mobile UX optimization
- **Mobile UX Optimization**
  - Conducting a thorough review and optimization of the user experience on mobile devices
  - Ensuring a smooth and polished experience across the entire application
- **Refining Birthday Card Design & Message**
  - Selecting or implementing custom fonts for the birthday message
  - Finalizing the wording and layout of the birthday message within the card
  - Considering adding more subtle interactive elements or refined animations to the card's content

## Recently Completed
- **PageTurningCard.tsx Updates**
  - Made fully responsive: stacks pages vertically on mobile, uses custom text with typography (replacing image), adjusts animations (slide on mobile, flip on desktop)
  - Updated props to accept `message` and `recipientName` instead of `messageImageUrl`
  - Added `useEffect` to listen for window resize for responsive logic
- **reward.tsx Updates**
  - Updated to pass a text message and recipient name to `PageTurningCard`
  - Ensured it uses the new `PageTurningCard` props correctly
- **landing.tsx Updates**
  - Re-styled to match the app's theme (purple/pink gradients, animated background elements, heart icon, sparkle effects), aligning with `reward.tsx` and `PageTurningCard.tsx`
- **Resolved JSX Linting Errors and TypeScript Prop Type Mismatches**
  - Fixed various errors across `PageTurningCard.tsx`, `reward.tsx`, and `landing.tsx`

## In Progress
- Finalizing the interactive birthday card
- Preparing for mobile UX optimization
- Reviewing and handling table-based questions

## Next Steps
1. **Optimize Mobile UX**: Conduct a thorough review and optimization of the user experience on mobile devices across the entire application
2. **Refine Birthday Card Design & Message**: Select or implement custom fonts for the birthday message, finalize the wording and layout of the birthday message within the card, and consider adding more subtle interactive elements or refined animations to the card's content
3. **Review and Handle Table-Based Questions**: Identify questions in the JSON data source that are table-based, decide on a strategy (e.g., remove, reformat, or flag for later)
4. **Testing**: Perform comprehensive testing on various mobile devices and screen sizes

## Active Decisions
- Maintain a mobile-first approach for UI/UX design and testing
- Ensure the romantic and celebratory theme (purple/pink gradients, festive icons) remains consistent and tastefully implemented
- Focus on creating a personalized and emotionally resonant experience for the user's crush
- Evaluate feasibility of rendering table-based questions or if they should be excluded for better UX

## Learnings & Insights
- Dynamic styling based on `window.innerWidth` in React components is best managed using state updated via `useEffect` and a resize event listener to ensure React's declarative rendering model is respected
- Tailwind CSS's responsive prefixes are powerful for general layout, but JavaScript-driven logic is often needed for more complex responsive animations and state-dependent styling

## Blockers/Questions
- None currently.

## New Issues & Notes
- Monitor performance impact of animations on lower-end devices
- Consider adding more visual feedback for user interactions
- Review accessibility of the new color scheme
